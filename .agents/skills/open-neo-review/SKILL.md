# Open-Neo Review

The event-first selection rules, experiment recommendations, report boundaries, and `NEEDS_RANKING` behavior are defined in `references/REVIEW_RULES.md`. Public inputs and outputs must conform to the JSON schemas in this Skill directory.

## Use when

- `open-neo-run` has completed Evidence consensus ranking.
- The user asks which events deserve validation, why rankings differ, or which assay should be run first.
- Patient-facing and technical review artifacts are required.

## Required input

The only CLI entry is `result_dir`, but the directory must contain:

- `run_manifest.json`
- `ranked_events.evidence_consensus.tsv`
- `ranked_peptides.evidence_consensus.tsv`
- `ranked_peptides.weighted_baseline.tsv`
- `all_tool_results.tsv`
- `validation_plan.tsv`

Optional evidence includes APPM, HLA LOH, CCF, purity, peptide safety, conflicts, ranking comparison, fusion/splice consensus with caller provenance, RNA expression/RNA VAF provenance fields, normal-background safety status, `clinical_context.yaml`, and `disease_profile.yaml`.

Before report generation, audit the Skill 2 cohort rule contract. The production manifest must pin one contract ID/version plus the ranking-profile, evidence-consensus-rules and contract SHA-256 values, report-contract version, and release-audit policy. `LOCKED_COMPARABLE` is required for formal cross-patient or cohort statistics. A legacy result whose exact profile/rules pair matches a known contract may be reviewed as `INFERRED_NOT_LOCKED`, but the patient release audit must remain draft and must not describe it as formally cohort-comparable. An explicit contract mismatch blocks review rather than silently falling back to `default`, a provisional alternate profile, or an older report template.

Use `--reports patient,technical,onepage` to select report artifacts. Use
`--reports none` for event review and experiment tables without document/PPT
generation. Report generation is MEDIUM risk; table-only review is LOW risk.
Use `--event-top-n` and `--candidate-top-n` independently from `--top-n`.
The defaults are 20 event representatives per applicable track and 100
cross-track peptide candidates; `--top-n` continues to control the first-batch
experiment set only.

## Procedure

1. Verify required files, run identity, available input/reference hashes, Evidence consensus completion, event-peptide mapping, hard-fail propagation, and missing-evidence semantics.
2. Return `NEEDS_RANKING` when event-level consensus is absent. Never substitute weighted Top20.
3. Preserve `pipeline_r_grade` and `pipeline_event_rank`; write independent `review_status`, `review_reason`, and `experiment_priority` fields.
4. Review event-level representatives, with at most two peptide-HLA pairs per event and explicit phase/redundancy handling.
5. Invoke ranking comparison, experiment design, HLA-LOH/APPM review, CCF/clonality review, the shared formal patient-report renderer, technical report, and bounded concept explanations. For patient reports, require event rows to carry concrete RNA measurements from the canonical evidence tables: `gene_expression_tpm`, `transcript_expression_tpm`, `rna_depth`, `rna_alt_reads`, and `rna_vaf`. If any value is absent, report the upstream evidence gap or ID-mapping gap from `expression_source`, `transcript_expression_source`, `expression_evidence_status`, `rna_vaf_source`, and `rna_support_status` instead of a generic omission. Fusion and splice sections must consume Skill2/production-wrapper consensus outputs and caller-provenance columns; Skill3 must not independently rescan EasyFuse, STAR-Fusion, Arriba, FusionCatcher, JAFFAL, SNAF or SpliceMutr raw outputs. Fusion reporting must use the single authoritative `fusion_consensus.tsv`, explicitly identify the fixed short-read panel version and completeness, list Arriba/STAR-Fusion/FusionCatcher support by normalized adjacency, report EasyFuse PASS as an aggregator layer rather than a fourth independent caller, and show long-read and DNA-SV confirmation in separate orthogonal columns. A missing caller is not a zero-call result, and a targeted rescue is not ordinary PASS consensus. In patient-facing reports, name the former safety module `自身相似性与正常组织风险筛查`, not clinical safety assessment. Render separate full-peptide normal-proteome, normal transcript/junction, normal immunopeptidome, similar-peptide cross-reactivity, source-gene normal-expression, critical-organ expression and hematopoietic-expression dimensions, followed by a database-screening conclusion and evidence completeness. A passing screen must say that no explicit same-sequence exclusion evidence was found in the queried databases and that experimental off-target/cross-reactivity validation has not been completed. For Fusion/Splice, label source-gene expression as auxiliary context and never present fusion-partner TPM/HSPC expression as evidence that the exact junction peptide occurs in normal cells.
   For HLA-LOH, normalize both candidate and tool alleles before exact allele-level matching. Display LOHHLA, SpecHLA, consensus state, tool QC and reason side by side. Only dual-tool `CONSENSUS_RETAINED` supports an intact restricting allele; single-tool retention, disagreement and missing/QC-insufficient evidence must block the formal release audit and be described as technical review evidence, never as “multi-tool consistent no LOH”. Unrelated HLA alleles may remain unassessed, but every restricting allele used by a displayed treatment candidate must close this gate.
   For SNV/InDel ALT=0, preserve three coverage-qualified interpretations from Skill2: depth absent/0 means unknown and is not negative; 0<depth<10 means insufficient power; depth>=10 means mutant-allele RNA expression was not supported despite evaluable coverage and is significant negative evidence. The last state must remain capped at R3, appear as `R3-REVIEW`, and recommend independent RNA confirmation or deprioritization rather than the generic missing-evidence workflow.
   Add an event-level splice filtering funnel from Skill2 artifacts. Show raw/unified junction count, alignment/coordinate QC, explicit unique reads, total coverage, PSI, matched-normal and normal-cohort comparisons, annotated-normal-isoform exclusion, ORF, NMD, junction-spanning peptide, normal-proteome exclusion and HLA presentation. For each stage show entered, assessed, passed, failed and unassessed counts plus the possible survivor range; never infer missing stages from Top candidates. Keep complete CCF coverage, point estimates, intervals, local total/major/minor CN, mutation multiplicity assumptions, purity sources, matched-normal contamination status and confidence in the technical report and evidence tables. The patient report must hide candidate-level CCF values and per-track CCF counts and show only: `多数候选目前尚不能可靠判断其是否存在于大部分肿瘤细胞中，因此克隆性仍是主要证据缺口之一。` Never convert high VAF alone into a clonal call.
   For SpliceMutr/SNAF candidates, report structural novelty, normal-catalog membership and cohort-based tumor specificity separately. `NOT_LISTED_IN_NORMAL_CATALOG` must be described as “目录中未收录，局部正常覆盖未确认”, not as a normal negative or tumor-specific proof. When `tumor_specificity_status=UNASSESSED_NO_COMPATIBLE_NORMAL_RNA_COHORT`, retain the N1/R3 ceiling and recommend a compatible normal cohort, targeted normal-junction assay or explicit locus-coverage review before progression.
   Report formal and exploratory Splice pools separately. Count HLA presentation as formal support only for `splice_formal_gate_pass=yes`; predictions generated for `EXPLORATION_EVIDENCE_INCOMPLETE` are technical exploration and must never appear in patient-facing text as “通过HLA呈递门槛”. If exact junction support reads exist but explicit unique-read metrics do not, describe the former as exact-junction support and the latter as unassessed rather than using contradictory labels.
   For every Fusion peptide, show `5′ partner residues | fusion junction | 3′ partner residues`, the junction position within the peptide, exact transcript and ORF identifiers, and whether both sides are present. Also show normal-proteome exact-match status. If boundary mapping is absent, state that fusion specificity is unproven; if the peptide is one-sided, do not call it a fusion neoantigen. Explain near-identical peptide alternatives as transcript/ORF/frame hypotheses requiring patient-specific adjudication.
   Honor `fusion_candidate_pool` from Skill2. Present `ORF_SUPPORTED` candidates as the formal fusion candidate layer; place `EXPLORATION_ORF_REQUIRED` records in a separate ORF-reconstruction queue with an R3 ceiling; retain `REJECTED_ORF_INVALID` only for audit or mechanism-led review. Skill3 must not upgrade an exploration candidate because its HLA presentation score is strong.
   Add a quantitative presentation table for patient and technical reports. Show NetMHCpan MT/WT EL and BA percentile ranks and IC50, MHCflurry MT/WT affinity percentile and presentation score, NetMHCstabpan stability outputs, MT/WT deltas or ratios, PRIME/BigMHC/DeepImmuno values, peptide length and mutation/junction position. Show predictor allele support and extrapolation status only when explicitly recorded. State that lower percentile rank is stronger, and that a ≤1% rank is a research prioritization reference rather than proof of immunogenicity or in-vivo presentation.
   For SNV/InDel candidates, display the mutation's structural-role interpretation separately from MT/WT numeric differences: conventional MHC-I primary anchor, putative TCR-facing, mixed, or unresolved. Explicitly flag a WT peptide that still predicts as a strong binder to the same HLA as a self-reactivity and immune-tolerance review requirement. Do not describe marginal MT advantage, agretopicity or DAI as positive immunogenicity evidence by itself; state that position labels are sequence-based hypotheses unless supported by binding-register, structural or functional evidence.
   Keep structured clinical diagnosis, computational analysis profile and molecular knowledge anchors as three separate report concepts. Never infer a diagnosis from the selected sarcoma/DSRCT profile. When EWSR1::WT1 is detected, place it in a prominent `核心分子发现` block and explain that it is a key molecular feature of DSRCT; if independently confirmed, it should be integrated with pathology and clinical findings. The report itself does not establish or replace a pathological diagnosis. Molecular-anchor priority changes display/review order only and never bypasses source-chain, ORF, presentation, normal-background or experimental gates.
6. Build a deterministic first-batch research set considering grade, RNA, self-similarity/normal-tissue risk screening, HLA diversity, clonality, event type, phase and redundancy. It is not a vaccine optimizer.
7. Generate short-peptide, long-peptide, minigene, targeted-RNA, and manual-review lanes.

## Clinical boundary

Allowed wording: computational candidate, experiment priority, missing evidence, suggested research validation route.

Forbidden wording: confirmed neoantigen, guaranteed benefit, clinical resistance, ineffective immunotherapy, drug recommendation, or established vaccine/treatment plan.

Skill3 is read-only with respect to Skill2 outputs. It uses `ranked_peptides.evidence_consensus.tsv`, `ranked_events.evidence_consensus.tsv`, `fusion_consensus.tsv`, `splice_consensus.tsv`, and `all_tool_results.tsv` as the authoritative source of report content.
It must not create a second `production_patient/` report tree or maintain an independent simplified patient-report template.
When a report defect originates in missing or invalid upstream evidence, record it and return it to Skill2 instead of fabricating a display value. When the defect is renderer-only, regenerate Skill3 without altering Skill2 outputs and record the before/after integrity check.

Before selecting candidates or rendering reports, Skill3 must also:

- inspect R1-R4 counts and block review when all-R4 coincides with absent core
  NetMHCpan/MHCflurry coverage;
- calculate tool coverage over unique applicable peptide-HLA combinations and
  distinguish missing, unsupported and failed results;
- show only event tracks present in the canonical event ranking;
- read the Splice prefilter funnel when Splice is present and explicitly
  distinguish strict PASS from bounded REVIEW and UNASSESSED stages.
