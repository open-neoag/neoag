# Open-Neo run stages

Skill2 is an orchestration layer. Production algorithms remain in their
existing modules and fine-grained Skills.

1. Input inventory, schema validation and deterministic routing.
   Plan/dry-run records size and nanosecond mtime instead of hashing files at
   least 50 MiB, so WGS BAMs and large references are never fully read merely
   to construct a plan.
2. Approval/Gateway boundary for execute or resume.
3. Optional automatic `rna_fusion_splice_v1` production manifest generation.
4. Doctor and tool/reference preflight.
5. RNA preprocessing or reuse: gene TPM, transcript TPM and RNA alt/VAF.
6. Production DAG planning and execution with per-stage checkpoints. Raw DNA
   resume regenerates the same capability-aware manifest and reuses only
   signature-matching completed stages.
7. Candidate normalization for VCF, fusion, splice, SV or peptide entries.
   Fusion normalization publishes the versioned fixed-caller availability table,
   one orientation-aware adjacency union and one authoritative consensus. EasyFuse
   aggregator status, embedded short-read caller support, optional long-read
   support and DNA-SV confirmation remain separate fields.
   Fusion candidates pass an explicit ORF gate: exact transcript and breakpoints,
   translation start, frame, translated ORF, peptide-in-ORF placement and NMD
   assessment. Candidates without this chain remain traceable in
   `EXPLORATION_ORF_REQUIRED`, are capped at R3 and never compete in the same
   layer as `ORF_SUPPORTED` fusion peptides.
8. Presentation, expression, RNA, HLA/APPM, CCF and safety evidence assembly.
   Core predictor reuse is schema- and key-validated. A supplied NetMHCpan or
   MHCflurry table that maps to fewer than the minimum candidate peptide-HLA
   keys is rejected instead of silently producing rank `99`, score `0`, or an
   all-R4 result. Raw caller output and normalized evidence are separate input
   contracts.
9. Canonical `all_tool_results.tsv` and explicit conflicts/consensus tables.
10. Immutable weighted baseline plus independent Evidence-consensus ranking.
11. Output manifest, run manifest, `run_state.json` and audit log.

Before ranking, calculate predictor coverage over unique applicable
peptide-HLA combinations. NetMHCstabpan applies only to supported HLA-I 8-11mer
combinations; report both numerator and this denominator, generate a missing
combination input for resume, and merge completed evidence without rerunning
already covered combinations.

Only materialize tracks supported by actual biological inputs. VCF splice-like
consequences remain SNV/InDel unless a canonical RNA junction event and its
provenance exist; Fusion is never relabelled DNA_SV. Preserve the complete
Splice funnel with PASS, REVIEW, FAIL and UNASSESSED counts. A bounded REVIEW
lane is not a strict full-funnel pass.

## Resource scheduler

Generated production manifests reserve `cpus` and `memory_gb` per stage and
define global `total_cpus`, `total_memory_gb`, and `max_parallel_stages`
budgets. A dependency-ready stage starts only when all three limits permit it.
The schedule is recorded in `production_resource_schedule.tsv`; active process
groups are terminated together when the parent run is interrupted, so resume
can safely reuse completed outputs and restart incomplete stages.

## Production Case Wrapper

For a completed case root plus somatic VCF, Skill2 should use
`scripts/run_production_case.sh` to convert standard upstream results into a
production manifest and run the final production runner. The wrapper requires
`--sample-id`, `--case-root`, `--outdir`, `--somatic-vcf`, and an approved local
NetMHCstabpan tree, then applies the sarcoma RNA-supported v2 weighted profile
and v3 Evidence-consensus rules by default. Optional overrides include
Sequenza/PURPLE paths, RNA FASTQ/BAM/VAF, STAR index, GTF, reference FASTA,
fusion caller roots, normal read-through/background assets, predictor dependency roots, NetMHCpan, NetMHCstabpan, PRIME/BigMHC/DeepImmuno evidence, and `--rna-threads`.
Exactly one RNA allele-evidence mode may be used: FASTQ pair, RNA BAM, or
existing RNA VAF. This path is for reusing completed upstream results and
producing final rankings/reports; raw heavy tool execution remains in the
Gateway-backed production DAG.

## RNA FASTQ profile

The built-in profile includes multi-batch paired FASTQ merging, FASTQ QC, STAR, Salmon gene/transcript TPM,
RSEM expression cross-check when a matching RSEM reference is available,
EasyFuse as the only scheduled fusion meta-workflow, RegTools, optional reviewed
SNAF/SpliceMutr workflows, fusion/splice normalization, candidate peptide
generation and downstream ranking. The formal fusion input is EasyFuse
`fusions.pass.csv` union high-confidence embedded-caller rows from `fusions.csv`.
Every rescued row retains its source, caller list/count and RNA-support reason;
`INTERNAL_CALLER_HIGH_CONFIDENCE` triggers
`CAP_CANDIDATE_UNION_INTERNAL_RESCUE` and cannot rank above R3 without
independent or orthogonal confirmation. Fusion intermediate generation consumes
the run-level HLA file and expands junction-crossing 8-11mer sequences into
peptide-HLA rows. A header-only peptide table is a failed stage, including on
resume, and is never accepted as a completed fusion ranking input.
Missing optional evidence remains `UNASSESSED` or `SAFETY_PARTIAL`.

## Purity/CNV

FACETS, Sequenza, PURPLE and ASCAT can run in parallel after BAM identity.
Sequenza is resume-safe: it can restart from an existing binned seqz, an
existing merged seqz, or completed per-chromosome seqz files before rerunning
only the remaining merge/binning/R-fit steps. `SEQUENZA_BIN_WINDOW` or
`BIN_WINDOW` controls the binning scale; the production default is 500.

## Resume

`run_state.json` records step status plus input and output signatures. A step is
reusable only when its previous status is reusable and all declared file
signatures still match. Large files use size and nanosecond mtime instead of rehashing.
Production stages additionally verify their declared outputs before reuse.

## Raw Heavy Finalization

Raw DNA/RNA Gateway DAGs must converge on the same final production standards as
`scripts/run_production_case.sh`: sarcoma RNA-supported v2 weighted profile,
v3 Evidence-consensus rules, required NetMHCpan/MHCflurry/NetMHCstabpan/NetChop
presentation predictors, optional PRIME/BigMHC/DeepImmuno evidence when configured, normal expression, normal ligandome, normal/reference proteome and pre-indexed normal junction backgrounds, and `patient,technical` reports. The raw DAG still
owns heavy upstream execution, but the generated production manifest should be
usable as the final production-results manifest shape once upstream stages have
completed. RNA allele evidence remains mutually exclusive across FASTQ-derived
STAR pileup, supplied RNA BAM pileup, and an existing RNA VAF table. Fusion evidence remains cumulative: preserve raw caller outputs and report whether each event is multi-caller, single-caller, or targeted-rescue supported.
