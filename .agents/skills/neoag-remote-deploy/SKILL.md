name: neoag-remote-deploy
description: Use this skill when deploying or migrating Project B / NeoAg Event Pipeline to a new machine with a programming agent. It provides a fixed SOP for release checksum verification, unpacking, preflight checks, core Python installation, optional env_tool/reference/licensed-tool asset migration, portable activation rewriting, runtime smoke tests, local manifest generation, read-only Doctor, deployment reporting, and safe tiered external-tool readiness checks. Do not use it for interpreting existing neoantigen results only.

# NeoAg Remote Deploy

## Purpose

Deploy Project B on a new machine with a programming agent using a fixed,
reproducible, safety-first SOP. Make the target machine ready for Tier 0/Tier 1
result review first, then use Doctor to decide whether Tier 2/Tier 3
external-tool deployment is needed. When full production execution is requested,
use the production-asset extension in this skill to migrate or rebuild
`env_tool`, references, and licensed-tool wrappers before running real data.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user asks to migrate, deploy, install, validate a release
tarball, configure local manifests, run deployment smoke tests, run Doctor, or
prepare a deployment report for a new server, workstation, or HPC node.

Do not use this skill when the task is only to review existing ranked peptides,
compare reports, explain HLA results, or analyze patient outputs.

## Inputs

- project checkout path or release tarball;
- optional `.sha256` file for the release tarball;
- optional deployment tier: `tier0`, `tier1`, `tier2`, or `tier3`;
- optional local `tools_manifest.yaml`, `reference_manifest.yaml`, and
  `sample_manifest.yaml`;
- optional container image manifests;
- optional source asset paths or old-machine SSH host for migration:
  `env_tool`, reference data root, and licensed-tool root;
- explicit human approval for any `--execute`, `--write`, rsync, large download,
  licensed-tool staging, or real pipeline run.

## Outputs

Write deployment outputs under a work directory, usually `work/remote_deploy/`:

- `preflight_report.md` and `preflight_status.tsv`;
- local manifests under `configs/local/` by default;
- `smoke_test_report.md`;
- `doctor/doctor_summary.md` and Doctor TSV/JSON outputs;
- `deployment_report.md`;
- `audit_log.jsonl`;
- optional `asset_migration_plan.tsv`, `asset_migration_report.md`,
  `production_runtime_status.tsv`, and rewritten local activation files when
  production assets are approved.

## Core Procedure

Follow this sequence. Do not skip ahead to full pipeline execution.

1. Checksum and unpack if given a release tarball:
   `scripts/01_unpack_release.sh`.
2. Preflight target machine:
   `scripts/00_preflight.sh --project-root <root> --outdir <outdir>`.
3. Install core Python entry points only:
   `scripts/02_install_core.sh --project-root <root> --python <python>`.
4. Check runtime entry points:
   `scripts/03_check_runtime.sh --project-root <root> --outdir <outdir>`.
5. Generate local manifests:
   `scripts/04_configure_manifests.py --project-root <root> --outdir configs/local`.
6. Run smoke tests for the requested tier:
   `scripts/05_run_smoke_tests.sh --project-root <root> --outdir <outdir> --tier tier0`.
7. Run read-only Doctor:
   `scripts/06_run_doctor.sh --project-root <root> --manifest-dir configs/local --outdir <outdir>/doctor`.
8. Write deployment report:
   `scripts/07_write_deploy_report.py --project-root <root> --workdir <outdir>`.

For Tier 3 or real VCF/BAM/FASTQ execution, continue with the production asset
extension before running real data:

9. Plan migration/rebuild of machine assets without copying anything:
   `scripts/08b_plan_asset_migration.sh --project-root <root> --outdir <outdir> --tools-root <target-env_tool> --reference-root <target-reference-root> --licensed-root <target-licensed-root>`.
10. After approval, sync approved assets from the old machine or staged local
    paths. Default is dry-run; use `--execute` only with approval:
    `scripts/09_sync_production_assets.sh --old-host <user@host> --old-env-tool <path> --old-reference-root <path> --old-licensed-root <path> --tools-root <target-env_tool> --reference-root <target-reference-root> --licensed-root <target-licensed-root> --outdir <outdir> --execute`.
11. When README-listed external tools should be installed or rebuilt on the
    target machine, use the single new-machine entrypoint:
    `scripts/16_install_new_machine.sh --project-root <root> --tools-root <target-env_tool> --licensed-root <target-licensed-root> --reference-root <target-reference-root> --standard --allow-download --execute`.
12. When licensed tools are available as files or directories already visible
    on the target machine, install them into the target licensed-tool root without
    creating `/mnt`, `/home`, or old-machine symlinks:
    `scripts/12_install_local_licensed_tools.sh --licensed-root <target-licensed-root> --netmhcpan-tar <netMHCpan.tar.gz> --mixmhcpred-dir <MixMHCpred_install> --execute`.
13. Rewrite local activation and wrappers so the new machine uses portable
paths, not old `/home`, `/mnt`, or stale conda prefixes:
    `scripts/10_rewrite_production_activation.sh --project-root <root> --tools-root <target-env_tool> --reference-root <target-reference-root> --licensed-root <target-licensed-root> --write`.
14. Validate the production runtime before real data:
    `scripts/11_validate_production_runtime.sh --project-root <root> --tools-root <target-env_tool> --outdir <outdir>/production_runtime --mini-prime`.

Claude Code is an optional agent-side dependency, not a bioinformatics runtime
dependency. Install it only when requested, with explicit download approval:
`scripts/17_install_claude_code.sh --channel stable --allow-download --execute`.
The installer uses Anthropic's official native installer, verifies
`claude --version`, and never performs login or stores credentials. The same
step is available through `16_install_new_machine.sh --claude-code`. Use
`--claude-code-channel latest`
or an exact `X.Y.Z` version only when explicitly requested.

Do not run `run-full`, `pipeline-full --execute`, or any patient workflow until
step 14 shows that VEP, reference FASTA, NetMHCpan, PRIME/MixMHCpred, and the
enabled Python dependencies are available or explicitly waived.

Fast path from an existing checkout:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_agent_deploy.sh --outdir work/agent_deploy
```

The bundled deployment scripts are more explicit and should be used when another
agent needs a step-by-step audit trail.

When local licensed-tool installers are missing, first retrieve an official or
user-approved download URL. Then use `12_install_local_licensed_tools.sh` with
`--allow-download`; do not download from third-party mirrors or bypass license,
registration, login, or click-through controls.

For new-machine migrations, prefer the consolidated entrypoint when the user
wants one command for asset sync, tool installation, activation rewrite,
runtime validation, and optional real VCF smoke:

```bash
bash .agents/skills/neoag-remote-deploy/scripts/16_install_new_machine.sh \
  --shared-asset-root <mounted-asset-root> \
  --allow-download \
  --execute
```

For README-listed open/conda tools, prefer `16_install_new_machine.sh` over
running many installer scripts manually. It defaults to Miniforge3 under
`/opt/neoag/env_tool/miniforge3` or `<tools-root>/miniforge3`; use
`--no-install-miniforge` only when a site-managed conda must be used instead.
Use `--allow-download` for Miniforge, conda packages, git clones, VEP cache, or
approved tool URLs.

`--all-open` and `--all` also enable the production-adjacent open/containerized
tooling used by copy-number and HLA workflows: SpecHLA, HLA-LA, Sequenza, and
HMF PURPLE/AMBER/COBALT. The installer expects their large databases and
container image tarballs to come from `configs/assets/production_assets.tsv`
when `--sync-assets` is used. Sequenza is installed as a conda env from
`conda/env.neoag-sequenza.yml`. Sequenza and ASCAT use
`with_bioc_data_cache.sh` to prefetch and verify GenomeInfoDbData in an isolated
Conda package cache; temporary metadata changes are restored automatically.
Splice helpers are installed from `conda/env.neoag-splice.yml`, with SNAF installed by default from its pinned Git revision in a Python 3.8 `neoag-snaf` compatibility environment (`--skip-snaf` opts out). SNAF pip uses `${SNAF_ENV_PREFIX}/bin/python -m pip`: pre-install `tensorflow==2.3.0` and `protobuf==3.20.3`, then install remaining SNAF runtime pins with those versions constrained, then install the pinned snapshot with `--no-deps` so pip cannot backtrack onto TensorFlow 2.12+. SpliceMutr is installed from a pinned source snapshot in `neoag-splicemutr` (`--skip-splicemutr` opts out). SpliceMutr smoke and `splicemutr-neoag` must call `${NEOAG_SPLICEMUTR_ENV_PREFIX}/bin/{python,Rscript,snakemake}` with `VIRTUAL_ENV`/`PYTHONPATH`/`R_LIBS*` unset; do not use `conda run`. Stage `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38` into that prefix R library, not only the reference-root copy. SpecHLA, HLA-LA, and HMF PURPLE are registered
by loading staged container images when Docker is available and by writing
portable wrappers/environment variables into the production activation script.
The consolidated `--splice` group intentionally excludes ASNEO, NeoSplice, and
splice2neo. Do not install or pull these optional workflows from this skill;
the supported splice set is RegTools, pVACsplice, SNAF, and SpliceMutr.
Because `--all-open` includes BigMHC, it also installs/repairs torch by default. SHERPA-Presentation is not publicly auto-downloadable; install it only with an authorized `--sherpa-source`, `--sherpa-archive`, or `--sherpa-container-image`.
Use `--skip-torch-install` only for a deliberately lightweight install, and then
run real VCF smoke with `--skip-real-vcf-bigmhc` until torch is installed.

VEP is pinned to release 105 by default (`--vep-version 105`) and must match the bundled `homo_sapiens/105_GRCh38` cache.

The core environment installer must keep MHCflurry compatible with modern
TensorFlow/Keras by installing the matching `tf-keras` shim and exporting
`TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS=1` in generated activation files.

SpecHLA registration requires a complete official source tree, not only its database and a runtime-only container image. Pass `--spechla-source <dir>` when the staged image does not contain SpecHLA. The installer repairs the DB symlink, exports the resolved `SPECHLA_DB`, rebuilds an old runtime-only image when required Python modules are absent, and creates both full-length and exon novoalign indexes when a licensed novoalign payload is present. Verification must require `script/whole/SpecHLA.sh`, `script/cal.hla.copy.pl`, `freebayes`, the Python runtime modules, the database marker, and any licensed novoalign indexes. `run_spechla_sample.sh` must retain its samtools FASTQ fallback because upstream bamUtil can fail after producing a valid extracted BAM.

HLA-LA registration installs the pinned Bioconda package into the configured shared tool root and links the real `HLA-LA.pl` into the tool home. A runtime-only image plus PRG graph is not a complete installation. Verification must execute the real program and require prepared graph markers such as `serializedGRAPH` and `PRG/graph.txt`.

NetMHCpan repair must rewrite any copied frontend that still defaults to an old
conda prefix from another host; after repair, `netMHCpan -h` must
work with `CONDA_BASE=<target-env_tool>/miniforge3`. When the asset manifest
provides the NetMHCpan image tarball, the installer loads it and writes the
portable container wrapper automatically; it does not download licensed payloads.

`16_install_new_machine.sh --run-real-vcf-smoke` runs an explicitly supplied
VCF smoke test after installation. The smoke test runs
MHCflurry and NetMHCstabpan by default; NetMHCstabpan may be skipped only for debugging because production evidence requires it,
and accepts `--real-vcf-smoke-top-n <N>` for a smaller or larger test.
Use `--skip-real-vcf-mhcflurry` only as a temporary fallback on hosts with
unresolved TensorFlow/Keras compatibility issues.
Use `--skip-real-vcf-bigmhc` only as a temporary fallback on hosts where torch
or BigMHC models are not ready; this is not a full production predictor smoke.

External assets are not bundled in the skill, but the installer accepts staged
asset locations so a new machine can prepare itself reproducibly:

- Real VCF smoke inputs: `--real-vcf`, `--real-annotated-vcf`,
  `--real-vcf-hla-alleles`, and `--real-vcf-hla-file`.
- BigMHC models: `--bigmhc-models-dir <dir>` copies a local model directory, or
  combine it with `--bigmhc-models-host <user@host>` to copy from a source
  server using rsync.
- Large model/reference sets can also be synchronized from a TSV manifest with
  `--asset-manifest configs/assets/production_assets.tsv --sync-assets
  --asset-source-host <user@host>`. The manifest stores paths and markers only,
  not the asset payloads.
- On a machine with a mounted shared asset tree, use `--shared-asset-root
  <mounted-root>` instead of `--asset-source-host`. Sources below the manifest's
  portable `/srv/neoag-assets/source` prefix are resolved below that root and
  linked into the configured reference, tool, and licensed roots. Existing
  targets are never replaced. Conda environments and writable runtime data stay local.
- SpecHLA, HLA-LA, Sequenza, and HMF PURPLE/AMBER/COBALT assets are part of the
  production asset manifest. SHERPA-Presentation is registered only from authorized local source/archive/container assets. Copy-mode asset sync dereferences source symlinks (`rsync
  -L`), so stable `/mnt` links can point at real source directories while the
  target receives concrete files/directories. When a `/mnt` symlink only
  resolves on the source host, use `--asset-source-host` so rsync resolves it
  there.
- Licensed tools remain explicit inputs via `--netmhcpan-tar`,
  `--netmhcpan-dir`, `--netmhcpan-url`, `--mixmhcpred-dir`,
  `--mixmhcpred-archive`, and `--mixmhcpred-url`; do not bundle or download
  them unless the user has rights and approves the source.
- Install OptiType and BAM-matcher through the `--standard` or `--all-open`
  profile of `16_install_new_machine.sh`. On capacity-constrained hosts, point their environment
  prefixes at the shared tool tree and expose them below the deployment root
  with symlinks. BAM-matcher requires its pinned Python 2.7 stack; install
  `Cheetah3==3.2.6.post2` with pip after creating the Conda environment because
  the current Conda package is not compatible with Python 2. Always regenerate
  the production activation and local overrides after moving either environment.
  BAM-matcher must use a `chr`-named GRCh38 FASTA and a compact primary-contig
  identity panel; keep the full omni2p5 VCF under `FACETS_SNP_VCF` instead of
  reusing it for fingerprints. Stage a separate AF-annotated common-SNP panel
  for GATK contamination estimates.

Production asset fast path after explicit approval:

```bash
bash .agents/skills/neoag-remote-deploy/scripts/08b_plan_asset_migration.sh \
  --project-root . \
  --tools-root /opt/neoag/env_tool \
  --reference-root /opt/neoag/refs \
  --licensed-root /opt/neoag/licensed_tools \
  --outdir work/agent_deploy

# Review work/agent_deploy/asset_migration_report.md first, then run approved sync/rewrite.
```

## Four-way Deployment Layout

Use `/opt/neoag/{code,conf,envs,refs,runs}` or an equivalent site root on target machines. Read `references/DEPLOYMENT_LAYOUT.md` and run `scripts/08_init_deploy_layout.py --deploy-root /opt/neoag --project-root <root> --outdir <outdir>` to write a layout plan. Add `--create` only after user approval.

## Deployment Tiers

Read `references/DEPLOYMENT_TIERS.md` before choosing a tier.

- Tier 0: result review and report generation. No heavy external tools.
- Tier 1: core scoring from existing intermediate tables.
- Tier 2: containerized prediction/tool subset with Doctor mini smoke.
- Tier 3: full production/HPC from BAM/FASTQ/VCF after approval.

Default to Tier 0 or Tier 1 unless the user explicitly needs full external-tool
execution.

## Safety Rules

- Do not copy patient BAM/FASTQ/VCF into the repository.
- Do not write `/home`, `/mnt`, `/root`, HPC private paths, or patient paths into
  tracked source files.
- Do not package licensed tools, license files, or controlled references.
- Do not download large references, install system packages, submit HPC jobs,
  delete files, or overwrite results without explicit approval.
- Do not copy or package licensed tools unless the user confirms the target use
  is licensed and the transfer is allowed. Prefer wrappers that point to a
  locally staged official installation.
- Do not migrate raw old-machine activation files verbatim. Always rewrite
  `activate_neoag_production_refs.sh`, `common.sh` defaults, VEP, NetMHCpan,
  PRIME, and MixMHCpred wrappers for the target machine.
- Do not trust long-running PRIME jobs until PRIME/MixMHCpred smoke tests have
  produced non-empty output. A running `PRIME.x` process with 100% CPU and a
  one-byte output file is not sufficient readiness evidence.
- `check-tools` or `which tool` is not enough for production readiness. Use
  Doctor mini smoke or mark the tool `PARTIAL`.
- Missing expression, HLA LOH, CCF, reference, or tool evidence must be reported
  as `MISSING`, `PARTIAL`, or `UNASSESSED`, not as biological negative evidence.
