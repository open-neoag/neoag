# Tool migration known issues

## Nextflow permission denied

Fix:

```bash
find bin -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec chmod +x {} \;
```

## VEP path/cache incomplete

Declare `vep.executable` and `vep_cache` in local manifests. Do not copy old
server paths into tracked files.

## MHCflurry path OK but model load fails

Mark `PARTIAL`; install/fetch models in the intended environment, then rerun
Doctor mini smoke.

## NetMHCpan / NetMHCstabpan license boundary

Do not redistribute licensed binaries, data directories, or license files. The
user must stage the official install locally and configure `tools_manifest.yaml`.

## LOHHLA / Polysolver / Novoalign

`which LOHHLA` is not sufficient. Require reference/config smoke or report
`PARTIAL`.

## FACETS / ASCAT / PURPLE

If wrapper exists but reference paths are absent, report
`REFERENCE_PATH_MISSING`.

## PRIME / BigMHC / MixMHCpred

If entrypoint exists but smoke fails, report
`TOOL_PATH_OK_BUT_SMOKE_FAILED`.

## Private paths in release

If release audit finds `/home`, `/mnt`, `/root`, patient IDs, site mount points,
or license files, mark `UNSAFE` and run release cleanup before publishing.

## Real Migration Failures Fixed In 2026-07 Deployment Test

### `neoag-doctor: command not found`

Cause: the project package source was present but the console script entry point
was not installed or wrapped in the active environment.

Fix:

- install editable entry points with `python -m pip install -e .`; or
- add a project-local `bin/neoag-doctor` wrapper that runs
  `python -m neoag.controlled_execution.doctor` with `PYTHONPATH=src`.

### `FileNotFoundError: vep`

Cause: VEP existed in a separate env but no `vep` command was visible to the
runtime process, or `NEOAG_VEP_BIN` was overwritten by a stale old-machine path.

Fix:

- write a target-machine `env_tool/bin/vep` wrapper;
- export `NEOAG_VEP_BIN` to that wrapper;
- validate `vep --help` after sourcing production activation.

### Missing `inputs.reference_fasta` / `NEOAG_REFERENCE_FASTA`

Cause: reference manifests pointed to old paths or activation did not export the
FASTA path required for automatic VEP annotation.

Fix:

- stage GRCh38 FASTA and `.fai` on the target machine;
- export `NEOAG_REFERENCE_FASTA` and `NEOAG_GENCODE_GTF`; or
- declare them in local manifests/run configs.

### NetMHCpan Exists But Is Not Runnable

Cause: copied wrappers may hard-code an old conda sysroot or old host paths.
The loader may be under `sysroot/lib64` instead of `sysroot/lib`, and complete
model thresholds may live under `Linux_$(uname -m)/data` rather than the
top-level `data` directory.
Observed error:

```text
netMHCpan: conda sysroot loader missing under a stale source-machine conda prefix
```

Fix:

- create a target-machine wrapper under `env_tool/bin/netMHCpan`;
- set `NEOAG_NETMHCPAN_HOME` to the licensed local install;
- probe both `sysroot/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` and the `sysroot/lib`
  fallback;
- set `NETMHCpan` to the platform directory, for example
  `${NETMHCPAN_HOME}/Linux_x86_64`, so complete threshold data are used;
- preserve the colon in command-line alleles (`HLA-A02:06`, not
  `HLA-A0206`);
- rewrite copied licensed frontend defaults so `CONDA_BASE` points to the target
  machine, usually `/opt/neoag/env_tool/miniforge3`;
- set temp dir to a writable location, usually `/tmp`;
- validate with a small `-pmhc` prediction and one prediction for every sample
  HLA allele; `-h` alone does not prove that model thresholds are complete.

`scripts/install_netmhcpan.sh --repair` must rewrite tcsh launchers and any
frontend containing a stale source-machine conda
defaults.

### MHCflurry Fails With Keras Cannot Be Imported

Observed error:

```text
ImportError: Keras cannot be imported. Check that it is installed.
```

Cause: MHCflurry 2.x runs against modern TensorFlow/Keras and needs the matching
legacy `tf-keras` shim with `TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS=1`.

Fix:

```bash
source /opt/neoag/env_tool/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate neoag-tools
TF_KERAS_SPEC="$(python - <<'PY'
import tensorflow as tf
major, minor, *_ = tf.__version__.split(".")
print(f"tf-keras>={major}.{minor},<{major}.{int(minor) + 1}")
PY
)"
pip install "$TF_KERAS_SPEC"
```

The consolidated installer now performs this repair automatically after the core
environment exists.

### PRIME Appears To Run Forever And Writes Only A One-Byte Output

Cause candidates observed during migration:

- PRIME entry point recursively called itself instead of the official script;
- PRIME was running from a root-owned or non-writable licensed-tool directory;
- MixMHCpred wrapper was missing or used the wrong Python environment;
- `lib/PRIME.x` was copied from an incompatible build or used stale temp paths;
- MixMHCpred was fixed after PRIME processes had already started.

Fix:

- stop the bad run before trusting outputs;
- stage PRIME under the migration `env_tool/tools/prime` or another writable
  target-machine path;
- ensure `PRIME` is the official entry point and `lib/PRIME.x` is compiled on
  the target machine;
- use a target-machine MixMHCpred wrapper and set `MIXMHCPRED_REAL_BIN`;
- run `11_validate_production_runtime.sh --mini-prime` and require non-empty
  output before real VCF/BAM/FASTQ execution.

### BigMHC Python Dependency Drift

Cause: BigMHC and immunogenicity code run in the runtime Python env, not always
in the tool install env.

Fix: validate these imports in the env used by `neoag`:

```bash
python -c 'import torch,numpy,pandas,scipy,sklearn,psutil'
```

Observed error during real VCF smoke:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'
```

Fix:

- full `--all-open` / `--all` installs must install torch by default because
  BigMHC is included by default;
- prefer CPU torch on new machines:
  `pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch`;
- if an approved local wheel cache is provided, pass `--torch-wheel-dir <dir>`;
- if a CUDA torch wheel is used, install all matching `nvidia-*-cu12`,
  `nvidia-nvjitlink-cu12`, `triton`, `filelock`, and `sympy==1.13.1`;
- use `--skip-real-vcf-bigmhc` only as a temporary smoke-test fallback, not as
  production readiness.

### Asset Symlinks Resolve On Source But Not Target

Observed with VEP plugins and SpecHLA DB: site-mounted asset entries were
absolute symlinks to a source-machine home directory. They resolved on the source host but not on
the new machine.

Fix:

- `15_sync_asset_manifest.sh` uses `rsync -aL` for ordinary reference assets so
  source symlinks are dereferenced and the target receives real files/directories;
- licensed-tool assets, including PolySolver, intentionally use `rsync -a` so
  vendor binaries or unreadable source symlink targets such as `novoindex` are
  preserved instead of dereferenced;
- use `--asset-source-host` when the symlink target only exists on the source
  host;
- use real marker files, such as `ref/hla.ref.extend.fa` for SpecHLA DB, rather
  than a bare directory marker.

### SpecHLA Starts But Fails During A Real Sample

Observed failures include bamUtil failing after `*.tmp.extract.bam` was created,
`ModuleNotFoundError: pysam`, `freebayes: command not found`, and licensed novoalign selecting a missing `.ndx`
database because a source-tree symlink resolved differently inside the container.

Fix:

- build the SpecHLA image with all Python modules listed in its runtime smoke;
- pass the host-resolved `SPECHLA_DB` into the container and mount that real path;
- when licensed novoalign is present, build both
  `hla_gen.format.filter.extend.DRB.no26789.ndx` and its `.v2.ndx` companion;
- if bamUtil fails but the extracted BAM is valid, use the containerized
  `samtools collate | samtools fastq` fallback;
- do not report SpecHLA production-ready from a Python-version-only smoke test.

### SNAF pip cannot find tensorflow==2.3.0

Observed error:

```text
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow==2.3.0 (from snaf) (from versions: 2.12.0rc0, ..., 2.21.0)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow==2.3.0
```

Cause: Skill1 launched pip against SNAF's `install_requires` as one transaction. Pip then backtracked TensorFlow 2.3's old numpy/h5py/scipy pins onto TensorFlow 2.12+ wheels, or `conda run python -m pip` inherited an outer `.venv`/`base` interpreter (Python 3.11+) instead of the Python 3.8 `neoag-snaf` prefix. Direct `tensorflow==2.3.0` plus `protobuf==3.20.3` into that prefix succeeds.

Fix: invoke `${SNAF_ENV_PREFIX}/bin/python -m pip`, pre-install `tensorflow==2.3.0` and `protobuf==3.20.3`, install remaining SNAF runtime pins with those versions constrained, then `pip install --no-deps` the pinned SNAF snapshot and lock `protobuf==3.20.3` again. Recreate `neoag-snaf` when it is not Python 3.8. The splice installer now performs this sequence.

### SpliceMutr smoke imports neoag-tools sklearn / missing BSgenome

Observed error:

```text
ImportError: /lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.29' not found
ERROR conda.cli.main_run:execute(148): `conda run python -c import Bio, numpy, pandas, sklearn; print("SpliceMutr Python runtime OK")` failed.
Error in read.dcf(file.path(p, "DESCRIPTION")): cannot open compressed file '/DESCRIPTION'
there is no package called ‘BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38’
```

Cause: `conda run -n neoag-splicemutr` inherited the Skill1 install PATH (EasyFuse, `neoag-tools`, outer `.venv`) and `VIRTUAL_ENV`/`R_LIBS`. Smoke used another environment's Python, which then loaded `/lib64/libstdc++.so.6`. The BSgenome check could also pass against the reference-root r_library and skip copying the package into `neoag-splicemutr/lib/R/library`.

Fix: call `${NEOAG_SPLICEMUTR_ENV_PREFIX}/bin/python` and `Rscript` directly with a cleaned `PATH`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, unset `VIRTUAL_ENV`/`PYTHONPATH`/`R_LIBS*`, and rsync BSgenome into the prefix R library when `DESCRIPTION` or `extdata/single_sequences.2bit` is missing there. `splicemutr-neoag doctor` now uses this isolated wrapper.

### VEP Plugin Directory Present But Plugin Files Missing

Observed error:

```text
VEP Wildtype plugin missing
VEP Frameshift plugin missing
```

Cause: the manifest path existed but resolved to an empty or broken symlink on
the target.

Fix: copy real `Wildtype.pm` and `Frameshift.pm` into
`<reference-root>/work/vep_plugins`, and keep `env_tool/work/vep_plugins` linked
there.
